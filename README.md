# StyleGAN-Educational-for-CelebA-TensorFlow-Keras
A compact and educational StyleGAN-style implementation built with TensorFlow 2.x and Keras, designed to demonstrate the core architectural ideas behind StyleGAN using the CelebA dataset. This project focuses on clarity and learning rather than full production-scale fidelity.
